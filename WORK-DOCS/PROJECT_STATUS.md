# GOB Project Status

## Current Phase: Phase 2 Setup & Foundation
**Status**: Recently completed Phase 1 cleanup and reorganization
**Next Focus**: Agent framework integration and centralized systems

## What Was Just Completed âœ…

### Phase 1: Foundation Improvements (COMPLETED)
- âœ… **Storage Layer Modularization**: Split monolithic 947-line storage.py into focused modules
- âœ… **Dependency Injection**: Implemented lightweight DI container for clean component management
- âœ… **Unified Configuration**: Created centralized config system with environment variable support
- âœ… **Environment Setup**: Replaced virtualenv with conda/mamba for better dependency management
- âœ… **Tier Reorganization**: Renamed heavyâ†’max, archived nano, established mini/main/max structure
- âœ… **Centralized Prompts**: Created core/prompts/ system and migrated mini/ to use it

### Key Infrastructure Improvements
- **Modular Architecture**: Storage layer now has clear separation (interfaces, backends, abstraction)
- **Dependency Management**: Conda environment with all required packages (numpy, openai, pydantic, etc.)
- **Configuration System**: Hierarchical config with environment overrides and validation
- **Prompt Management**: Centralized prompt system with tier-based organization
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive validation of data saving and system integration

## Currently Working On ðŸ”„

### Phase 2 Immediate Tasks
1. **Main Agent Integration** - Migrate main/ from local prompts/ to centralized core/prompts/
2. **Max Agent Integration** - Migrate max/'s extensive prompt library to centralized system
3. **DI Container Adoption** - Update main/ and max/ to use core.di.Container
4. **Plugin Architecture** - Foundation for tool extensions and modular capabilities

### System Architecture Status
- **Mini Tier**: âœ… Fully functional with centralized prompts and DI
- **Main Tier**: ðŸ”„ Ready for integration, needs prompt migration
- **Max Tier**: ðŸ”„ Ready for integration, extensive prompt library to migrate
- **Core Framework**: âœ… Modular, tested, and production-ready

## Technical Debt Addressed
- Eliminated circular dependencies in storage layer
- Removed hardcoded paths and configurations
- Standardized async patterns and error handling
- Implemented proper resource cleanup and connection management
- Added comprehensive type hints and validation

## Performance & Reliability
- **Database**: 577KB communal brain with 55+ memories
- **Memory Management**: Efficient vector search with proper indexing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and comprehensive logging
- **Testing**: Full integration tests passing for data persistence

## Next Milestone Goals
- Complete main/ and max/ integration with centralized systems
- Establish plugin architecture for extensibility
- Implement health monitoring and metrics
- Create comprehensive testing suite for all tiers

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Core infrastructure is solid and tested
- **Medium Risk**: Agent framework integration requires careful prompt migration
- **Low Risk**: Plugin architecture can be developed incrementally

## Success Metrics
- All three tiers (mini/main/max) using centralized systems
- Clean dependency injection across all components
- Comprehensive test coverage for new architecture
- Performance maintained or improved
- Developer experience significantly enhanced
