# Roadmap Vision

- Stage 1 – Foundation Hardening: Finish aligning docs/tests with the current tier layout, tighten persistent conversation handling, and ship the cross-tier prompt + logging story so Mini/Main/Max share the same communal brain contracts confidently.
- Stage 2 – Tier-2 Agent Enablement: Lift the main/ agent onto the communal brain: shared prompts via core.prompts, DI container wiring, and a minimal tool-execution surface so Tier 2 demonstrates agent behaviors on top of the core.
- Stage 3 – Agent Ecosystem Growth: Bring max/ online with staged milestones (prompt migration, communal memory bridge, streaming UI), then layer advanced capabilities like delegation/communication and richer knowledge hygiene.
- Stage 4 – Operational Excellence: While stages 2–3 progress, fold in CI, container images, observability, and living documentation so adding new devices or tiers stays predictable.
