She built her own curriculum using YouTube, freeCodeCamp, and Stack Overflow, wrote blog posts to solidify her learning, and tackled big projects like a multiplayer browser game—learning from crashes and CORS errors along the way.\n\nMaya later joined open‑source communities, got mentorship from a seasoned dev, created a portfolio (Garden Planner, StorySync, algorithm visualizations), and landed a junior full‑stack job at a game studio. Even now she keeps learning new languages, mentors newcomers, and works on an AI tutoring bot. The core message: curiosity, persistence, and community can turn anyone into a developer—even without a formal degree.",
