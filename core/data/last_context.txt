=== RECENT CONVERSATION HISTORY ===
**USER**: what was the first documented full moon
**ASSISTANT**: **Short answer:**  
The earliest *written* references that can be identified as a description of a **full‑moon** come from the ancient Near East and China, roughly ​1200 – 800 BCE. Because “full moon” is a visual, recurring phenomenon, many early societies noted it in their calendars and omen texts, but the surviving records are fragmentary, so we can’t point to a single “first” entry with absolute certainty.

---

### Why the record is ambiguous

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|--------------|
| **Oral tradition** | Before cuneiform or oracle‑bone script, peoples described the lunar cycle verbally; nothing survives in writing. |
| **Different terminology** | Early texts rarely say *“full moon”* in modern English. They use phrases like “the moon is bright,” “the moon is round,” or specific ritual names. |
| **Fragmentary tablets** | Many clay tablets or bone inscriptions are broken, damaged, or unreadable, leaving gaps in the chronological record. |

Because of these factors, scholars talk about “the earliest *known* mention” rather than an unequivocal “first documented” event.

---

### The strongest candidates

| Culture / Source | Approx. Date | What the text says (translation) | Why it is a full‑moon reference |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Sumerian/Old Babylonian Astronomical Diaries** | 7th century BCE (≈ 652 BCE) | “The moon was **bright like a full** and the omens were favorable.” | The phrase “bright like a full” is interpreted as a description of the moon at its maximum illumination. |
| **Chinese Shang‑Zhou oracle‑bone inscriptions** | Late 13th century BCE (≈ 1200 BCE) | “月盈” (yuè yíng) – literally “the moon is full.” | The character **盈** was used in divination to denote the moon at its fullest phase. |
| **Mari (ancient Syrian) clay tablets** | Early 2nd millennium BCE (≈ 1800 BCE) | “The moon is round; the waters rise.” | The “round” description matches a full lunar disc, though the wording is more poetic than technical. |
| **Babylonian “Enuma Anu Enlil” omen series** | 7th century BCE | “When the moon is full, the king….” | This is an explicit reference to the *full moon* as a calendrical/astrological marker. |

Among these, the **Chinese oracle‑bone record “月盈” (yuè yíng)** is often cited as the *earliest clear lexical item* meaning “full moon,” because the glyphs are legible and the dating of the bones (≈ 1200 BCE) predates the Babylonian astronomical diaries by several centuries.

---

### How scholars date the observations

1. **Paleographic analysis** – comparing the shape of cuneiform or oracle‑bone characters to well‑dated typologies.  
2. **Stratigraphic context** – layers of archaeological deposits where the tablets or bones were found give a relative age.  
3. **Radiocarbon dating** – especially for organic material (e.g., the bone itself) to obtain an absolute range.  
4. **Cross‑referencing with astronomical retro‑calculations** – confirming that the described lunar phase aligns with the known lunar calendar of that year.

### A quick timeline for context

| Time (BCE) | Milestone related to lunar documentation |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ~1800      | Mari tablets describe a “round moon.” |
| ~1200‑1100 | Shang‑Zhou oracle‑bone inscription uses the term **月盈** (“full moon”). |
| ~652       | Babylonian Astronomical Diary notes a “bright/full” moon and ties it to omen‑reading. |
| 2nd cent. CE | Ptolemy’s *Almagest* (c. 150 CE) formally catalogs lunar phases, including the full moon, for the first time in a systematic, mathematically‑based treatise. |

---

### Bottom line

- **Earliest clear lexical evidence:** Chinese oracle‑bone inscription **“月盈”** (≈ 1200 BCE).  
- **Earliest astronomical‑style entry:** Babylonian Astronomical Diaries (≈ 652 BCE).  
- **First systematic, mathematically‑based description:** Ptolemy’s *Almagest* (2nd century CE).

So, while we can point to a few strong candidates, the **“first documented full moon”** is best understood as a series of early, independent recordings rather than a single definitive entry. If you’re interested in digging deeper, the **British Museum’s “Babylonian Astronomical Diaries”** collection (online) and the **Academia Sinica’s database of Shang‑Zhou oracle‑bones** are excellent primary‑source repositories.
