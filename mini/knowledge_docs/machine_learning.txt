Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn 
and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing 
computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Learning from labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, Autoencoders

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learning through interaction and feedback
   - Agent learns by trial and error
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics

Popular ML Libraries:
- Scikit-learn: General-purpose ML
- TensorFlow: Deep learning
- PyTorch: Deep learning research
- XGBoost: Gradient boosting
